# üìä **Healthcare KPIs Dashboard**

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
The **Healthcare KPIs Dashboard** is an interactive and insightful data visualization project built using **Power BI**. It provides a comprehensive view of key performance indicators (KPIs) in a healthcare environment, enabling hospital administrators, clinicians, and decision-makers to monitor and analyze critical metrics such as patient admissions, readmission rates, length of stay, and overall operational performance.

This dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by offering actionable insights to improve patient care, optimize hospital resources, and enhance operational efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating measures and calculated columns.
- **Excel**: Data source for cleaning and structuring healthcare data.
- **SQL (Optional)**: For advanced data processing (if used during data preparation).
- **GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## üì• **Data Overview**
The dataset consists of healthcare records with fields including:
- **Patient Name**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Blood Type**
- **Medical Condition**
- **Admission Type** (Emergency/Elective/Urgent)
- **Date of Admission**
- **Discharge Date**
- **Doctor**
- **Hospital**
- **Billing Amount**
- **Insurance Provider**
- **Readmitted Status**
- **Length of Stay**

---

## üìà **KPIs and Measures**
Here are the key measures created using DAX:

1. **Total Patients**:  
```dax
Total Patients = COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset')
```

2. **Readmission Rate**:  
```dax
Readmission Rate = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER('healthcare_dataset', 'healthcare_dataset'[Readmitted] = "Yes")),
    COUNTROWS('healthcare_dataset'),
    0
)
```

3. **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)**:  
```dax
ALOS = AVERAGE('healthcare_dataset'[Length of Stay])
```

4. **Total Billing Amount**:  
```dax
Total Billing Amount = SUM('healthcare_dataset'[Billing Amount])
```

## üí° **How to Use the Dashboard**
1. **Filter by Date Range**: Use the **Date of Admission** slicer to view trends over a specific time frame.
2. **Analyze by Hospital or Doctor**: Select a particular hospital or doctor to compare performance.
3. **Explore Admission Types**: See how many patients were admitted as **Emergency**, **Elective**, or **Urgent** cases.
4. **Drill-Through Functionality**: Right-click on visual elements to view detailed patient-level data.
5. **Identify Trends**: Analyze readmission rates over time using the **Readmission Trends** chart.
