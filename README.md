## ðŸ“Š Power BI Projects

This section showcases a collection of Power BI dashboards developed to solve real-world business problems across domains such as sales, operations, HR, and marketing. These projects demonstrate my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights through interactive reports, DAX measures, and visual storytelling. Each dashboard is designed with usability in mindâ€”leveraging slicers, KPIs, dynamic charts, and filters to enable deep exploration of the underlying data.

The dashboards are built using Power BI Desktop and published to the Power BI Service where applicable. Some projects also involve data modeling, data cleaning with Power Query, and connecting to multiple data sources such as Excel, SQL Server, and web APIs.
